title: Programming Goals For 2012
---

Ah, January. It's a new year, and a time wherein we set new goals for the year. An important part of goal setting is visibility -- not only being reminded of your goals, but being able to track and measure your progress towards attaining them.

### Learn a Functional Language

I mostly do object oriented programming using Ruby on a day-to-day basis. It's high time I learn a functional language. The paradigm shift will not only help me think in new ways, but it will open up new avenues of solving problems.

Here are some candidate languages:

* Haskell
* Clojure
* Scheme
* Erlang

I've been reading [Learn You a Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com), and I'm quite enjoying it, but Clojure has a certain appeal to me I can't quite put my finger on yet.

### Have a Better Understanding of the Foundations

I primarily work on HTTP APIs, but I don't feel that I understand enough about HTTP, TCP/IP, and networking in general. I need to rectify this.

### Publish More Blog Articles

I want to ensure my learnings have been captured and thought out, so I intend on blogging about them much more frequently than I have in the past. This article, in fact, is the first step towards this goal.
